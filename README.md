## Detect n Dash

### Description:

**Detect n Dash** is a quick stealth-action arcade game built in C++ using the Raylib library. In this game, you must collect gold coins scattered across the map while avoiding detection from enemies. The enemies are equipped with a cone of vision, and if they catch you, you'll be sent back to the spawn point. You have only 3 lives, and the challenge is to collect all the coins as quickly as possible without getting caught!

### Features:

- **Stealth-Based Gameplay**: Avoid being spotted by detectors that scan the environment with their cone of vision.
- **Time-Based Scoring**: Your final score depends on how quickly you can collect all the coins.
- **Challenging Lives System**: With only 3 lives, every step you take matters.
- **Smooth Player Movement**: Navigate the map and dodge detection seamlessly.

### Controls:

- **WASD**: Move the player.
- **Mouse**: Look around.

### How to Play:

1. Collect all the Candy Bags scattered around the map.
2. Avoid detection from enemies, who will send you back to the start if they spot you.
3. Complete the challenge with only 3 livesâ€”if you lose them all, it's game over.
4. Collect all coins in the fastest time possible.
